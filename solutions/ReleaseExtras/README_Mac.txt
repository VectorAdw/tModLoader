Automatic Install:
To install tModLoader, simply run the tModLoaderInstaller.jar file after extracting these file to a temporary folder. Java 1.7 or higher is required for the installer to run. The installer will make a window pop up, informing you of either success or failure.

Manual Install:
If the installer for some reason does not work, or if you do not want to install/upgrade Java, you may also do a manual install. Go to your Terraria's Steam folder; for most people, this will be "Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Terraria/Terraria.app/Contents/MacOS". Then, copy all these files into that folder using the special merge copy and paste (This is necessary since Mac will delete folders rather than merge folders when copy and pasting). To do this, hold down the Option key as you drag-and-drop all the files and folders from this folder and drop them into the folder mentioned above. If you do this, youâ€™ll see a dialog with a Merge button and you can click it to merge folders like you would on Windows or Linux. If you messed this up, you'll need to first "verify game integrity" to get the files back (see below) and then copy the libMonoPosixHelper.dylib file into the osx folder separately from the other files. You may wish to back-up your vanilla Terraria.exe first. Additionally, if you are updating from 0.10.1.5 or earlier, you'll need to delete "MP3Sharp.dll", "Ionic.Zip.Reduced.dll", and "Mono.Cecil.dll" from that folder.

To enter your hidden Library folder, in the Finder open the "Go" menu, then hold down the "Alt" key. The hidden Library will become visible. To enter the Terraria.app folder, right-click it then click on "Show Package Contents".

Run tModLoader:
To run tModLoader, run Terraria as normal from Steam. Do not attempt to run it from this folder if you used the installer.

Why are there EXE files?:
Don't worry about it, you didn't download the wrong thing.

Uninstall/Switch back to un-modded Terraria:
If you want to play un-modded Terraria or join a un-modded Terraria server, you can't use tModLoader. You need to use steam to "verify game integrity" which will restore the files back to the un-modded Terraria. (You'll need to reinstall tModLoader later.) See this video to see how to do that: https://gfycat.com/RapidBelovedFrog
