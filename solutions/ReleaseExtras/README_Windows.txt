Automatic Install:
To install tModLoader, simply run the tModLoaderInstaller.jar file after extracting these file to a temporary folder. Java 1.7 or higher is required for the installer to run. The installer will make a window pop up, informing you of either success or failure.

Manual Install:
If the installer for some reason does not work, or if you do not want to install/upgrade Java, you may also do a manual install. Go to your Terraria's Steam folder; for most people, this will be "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Terraria". Then, copy all these files into that folder. You may wish to back-up your vanilla Terraria.exe first.

Manual Install Video Guide:
If the above instructions still aren't clear enough, the manual install can be seen in these 2 quick videos:

Run tModLoader:
To run tModLoader, run Terraria as normal from Steam. Do not attempt to run it from this folder if you used the installer.

Uninstall/Switch back to un-modded Terraria:
If you want to play un-modded Terraria or join a un-modded Terraria server, you can't use tModLoader. If you used the automatic installer correctly, simply launch "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Terraria\Terraria_v1.3.5.3.exe" to launch the vanilla Terraria Client. If you messed up, did the manual install, or that file launches tModLoader, you need to use steam to "verify game integrity" which will restore the files back to the un-modded Terraria. (You'll need to reinstall tModLoader later.) See this video to see how to do that: https://gfycat.com/RapidBelovedFrog
